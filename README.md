# ge-margins
A Runescape 3 margin tracker which checks whether tax is applied and applies it correctly. Also shares functional UI akin to GE in game.

#To Use
Type in the item's name (with correct casing). This fetches the item from the Grand Exchange database with current market prices and injects it into Buy/Sell numerical fields. 
The prices can be adjusted with the side buttons and they are functionally identical to GE button calculations. 
These can then be manipulated to reach whatever tax deducted profit margins.
Thank you, happy flipping!
